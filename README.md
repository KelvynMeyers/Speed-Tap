# Speed-Tap

 This is my first attempt at creating a Unity-based mobile game for  mobile devices.
 
 The objective of the game is to press tiles to increase your score before a set timer runs out.
 

## Features:

 - Tap randomly moving tiles as fast as you can to earn points
 - Compete against yourself by setting new highscores
 - Simple design and layout allow for easy navigation and gameplay understanding
 - Sound implemented for all actions, buttons, and achievements to make gameplay more exciting
 

## Settings

 Players can compete against their own highscore for these timer values:
 - 10 seconds
 - 30 seconds
 - 60 seconds
 
 Players can perform these actions in the settings menu:
 - Change Timer Value
 - Reset Highscore for specified Timer Value
 
 ## Credits
 Developed by Kelvyn Meyers.
 All credits for sound design are accessible via the title screen.
